*) If you experience an error similar to:

/usr/local/opt/freeimage/include/FreeImage.h:153:17: error: typedef redefinition with different types ('int32_t' (aka 'int') vs 'signed char') typedef int32_t BOOL; ^ 

you can fix it by editing `/usr/local/opt/freeimage/include/FreeImage.h`
and surrounding 

typedef int32_t BOOL;

with:

#ifndef __MACTYPES__
typedef int32_t BOOL;
#endif
